`JSX element`
- combination of JS code & HTML tags
- React components need to return a single JSX element

Our own components - Board, Square
- must start with capital letter

To remember things, components use state.

By calling this setValue function from an onClick handler, 
you’re telling React to re-render that Square whenever its <button> is clicked. 
After the update, the Square’s value will be 'X'


To determine winner - board need to know state of each 9 square components
- Board needs to ask each Square for that Square’s state (OR)
- store the game’s state in the parent Board component instead of in each Square
    Board component can tell each Square what to display by passing a prop

2 approaches to changing data
- to mutate the data directly by changing data's values
- replace the data with a new copy

Avoiding direct data mutation lets you keep previous versions of the data intact, and reuse them later.

Immutability makes it very cheap for components to compare whether their data has changed or not. 

React components group rendering logic together with markup because they are related.

use JavaScript inside JSX — with curly braces { }

A <Switch> looks through its children <Route>s and renders the first one that matches the current URL.
