mongo vs mongosh

old mongoDb shell is called         mongo
new mongoDb shell is called         mongosh

- mongo (or) mongosh === a mongo client
- which is used to ask query to mongoDb server

mongo was fine
but overtime shell can be used to do lots & lots of stuff
simple queries to complex admin operations
so, new mongo client ===> mongosh
mongosh client is standalone product separate from MongoDb server
